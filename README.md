# tutorial-examples
Randoop tutorial examples and text.

Running

```
./gradlew build
```

will create `build/libs/tutorial-examples-X.jar` where `X` is the version number.
(Version numbers should be the same as the Randoop version number.)

The tutorial text is located in `src/docs/text/`.
To generate PDF, run `pdflatex randoop-tutorial.tex` in that directory.
